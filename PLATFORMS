- perfect

FreeBSD (x86):
- perfect

OpenBSD/NetBSD:
- unknown

Linux (Ultra Sparc):
- perfect 

Linux (Alpha):
- perfect

Solaris 8 (SunOS 5.8, Sparc SunFire 880):
- possibly with small libltdl compile problem
  (add #define LT_USE_POSIX_DIRENT in line 88 of ltdl.c).

OS X (10.3, PowerPC):
- perfect

MinGW:
- linking against libstdc++ fails
    my workaround: rename libstdc++.la
    Gerrit P. Haase writes: 
      Linking -lstdc++ with the provided libtool fails also on Cygwin, this
      is a problem with libtool, there is unfortunately no flag to tell
      libtool how to do its job on Cygwin and it seems that it cannot be the
      default to set the library check to 'pass_all'.  Workaround as you
      suggested doesn't work on Cygwin, IIRC.  I use a patched libtool for
      these kind of problems.

Cygwin:
- compiles fine after touch src/plugins/printable/config.h
- plugins do not load (weird Win32 error code)
