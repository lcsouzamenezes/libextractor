This file lists the known problems with libextractor on various
platforms.  Let us know if you know more about it than we do.

GNU/Linux (x86):
- perfect, but with gcc 3.3 you must turn off optimizations!

GNU/Linux (32-/64-bit PowerPC):
- perfect

GNU/Linux (Ultra Sparc):
- perfect

GNU/Linux (Alpha):
- perfect

GNU/Linux (x86_64, Fedora Core)
- set "CFLAGS=-fPIC" before running configure

FreeBSD (x86):
- perfect

OpenBSD 3.8:
- Chan Siu Ming <namely_void@yahoo.co.uk> writes:
  - libtool is good to have
  - OpenBSD 3.8 also doesn't have CODESET in langinfo.h (used in about three places.) I'm not sure how to cleanly overcome this.
  - for some reason, convert.a is linked with a static version of libiconv.a, so that convert.a ends up containing convert.o
    and libiconv.a, which confuses the linker, because archives aren't supposed to contain other archives. Removed the ICONV
    stuff from convert_la_LDFLAGS in some Makefiles and it seemed to get past that.

- NetBSD:
- unknown

OS X (10.3, PowerPC):
- (X)PDF extractor does not work properly, especially with gcc 3.x
  (use the C-based pdfextractor (default now anyway))

Solaris 8 (SunOS 5.8, Sparc SunFire 880):
- unknown

Solaris 10
- reported success for 0.5.11 with minor modifiations (on LE mailinglist, 2006/3/27)

MinGW:
- linking against libstdc++ fails
    my workaround: rename libstdc++.la
    Gerrit P. Haase writes:
      Linking -lstdc++ with the provided libtool fails also on Cygwin, this
      is a problem with libtool, there is unfortunately no flag to tell
      libtool how to do its job on Cygwin and it seems that it cannot be the
      default to set the library check to 'pass_all'.  Workaround as you
      suggested doesn't work on Cygwin, IIRC.  I use a patched libtool for
      these kind of problems.

Cygwin:
- compiles fine after touch src/plugins/printable/config.h
- plugins do not load (weird Win32 error code)
