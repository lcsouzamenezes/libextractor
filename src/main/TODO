* bz2 decompression (not implemented)
* extract-from-bz2-file test fails!

* MAX_META_DATA buffer of 32 MB is a bit big as a non-growing default size;
  also, valgrind reports it is leaked even though printf-debugging shows it is not (!?)

* for some reason, if a plugin crashes or something goes wrong (i.e. with a seek),
  the whole system hangs (not good...)
