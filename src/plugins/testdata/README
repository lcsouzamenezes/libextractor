These files are binary test files that were publicly available
on the Internet and were reproduced here to test the logic of
the respective plugin.  They are not under the "GPL", but 
assumed to be reproducable (especially in this context) as they
are used for compatibility testing and their content is often
so trivial that they may not be copyrightable in the first place.
In other cases, they were distributed liberally by the original
authors.
