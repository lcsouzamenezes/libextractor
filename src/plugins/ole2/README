WordLeaker v.0.1 (c) 2005

Shows information about a Word file.
It can show all the summary and the revision history of the file.

It should be portable but, for now, it doesn't work in Linux. I haven't had
the time to debug it but I'll do when I can.

There are a lot of things that don't work yet, if you want to help contact me.
