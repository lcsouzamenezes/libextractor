This is to become an extractor for OpenOffice formats.

OO uses 'zip' files that contain a file 'meta.xml' which
in turn contains the data we care about.

The plugin will use zlib to get to the zip-contents
(the code here so far is a copy of some demo code from
 zlib, which I hope will work nicely).

Anyway, after we get to meta.xml we'll need to parse 
it.  Both is not done yet, standby.
